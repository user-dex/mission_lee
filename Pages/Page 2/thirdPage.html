In Every Beat of My Heart<br>

In those silent moments when the world moves away,<br>
My mind gets lost over you, my love.<br>
Your laughter is the melody my soul yearns to hear;<br>
A symphony that softly plays in corners of my heart.<br>

As the sun sets low into the horizon and turns the sky into indigo,<br>
I see your face in the stars, a constellation of affection.<br>
Your eyes have the fire of a thousand suns,<br>
And in their gaze, I find a universe of just us.<br>

Each touch and whispered word amidst,<br>
Is a testament to a bond so pure and deep. It is your presence that acts as medicine to my deepest wounds,<br>
And your arms, a haven where all fears disappear.<br>

In the darkness of night, when dreams join the threads of reality,<br>
The thought that you are mine soothes my heart.<br>
Every day with you is an adventure,<br>
A travel through landscapes painted in shades of happiness and tranquility.<br>

My love towards you is like a river that keeps flowing,<br>
Carving in the stone of everyday life. You are the light in the darkest, the hope in despairs,<br>
And the reminding voice inside, always assuring you that yes, true love exists.<br>

So here's to us, to the moments which define our story,<br>
To laughter and tears, the dreams and the reality.<br>
With every heartbeat, with every breath I take,<br>
I treasure you, adore you, love you more with each passing day.❣️<br>
